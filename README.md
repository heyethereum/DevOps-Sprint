# DevOps Sprint

This project is inspired by The Mumbai Testnet being down during one of the super long weekend in May 2022. I had to spend my whole super long weekend migrating everything from the Mumbai testnet to the Avalanche Fuji Testnet.

So here it is to create my own Kittens Testnet, create and test smart contracts on my private local Kittens Testnet. Step by steps details of launching a local private blockchain can be found at the private-blockchain folder
